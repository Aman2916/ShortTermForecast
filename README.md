Solar Forecasting & PV Power Prediction App <br>
Predicts solar irradiance (DNI, DHI, GHI) and photovoltaic (PV) power generation based on weather forecasts.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js (for building interactive user interfaces)
D3.js (for visualizing solar irradiance and power data)
Bootstrap (for UI components)
Backend:

Node.js (for handling server-side logic)
Express.js (for setting up APIs)
MongoDB (for storing weather and solar data)
External APIs:

OpenMeteo (for fetching weather data)
PVGIS or Solcast (for solar irradiance forecasting)
Modeling & Simulation:

PVlib (for simulating PV power output based on irradiance)
